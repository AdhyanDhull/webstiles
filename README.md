# What is a Webstile?

Webstiles is an easy tool to help you prototype in the browser. It is a type of design deliverable, heavily inspired from Style Tiles.

Webstiles tell the mood of the website, by defining typography, colors, layout and buttons. They help communication between the designer and the client, and are a step before full-fledged mockups, but one step after wireframes.

# Hmm… But why should I use webstiles?

Usually, clients require more than 1 concept designs. Instead of creating a full mockup, you can create a few webstiles quickly, and send those over, to judge their mood and reactions. When you think you know exactly what the client wants, you can send over a mockup! BAM!

Webstiles are also useful when doing any type of web design work. They help you bring your idea to paper, and you don't spend a lot of time worrying on details on the final site — they are already finalized in your webstile!

TL;DR Webstiles are a quick and easy to way to bring your idea to life

# Why Webstiles?

Webstiles evolved as a personal need. I loved the concept of Style Tiles, but hated PS at the same time (I use complex baseline grids in my web design work, and PS wasn't really best for that), so I took the responsibility of making Webstiles. When came to use it more and more, I realized that other people could benefit from it too, and you can see the result!

## Features

Webstiles shares a lot of common features with Style Tiles, but has a few key changes, and introduces some new concepts like

* Colors
* Typography
* Form
* Buttons
* Adjectives [Mood]
* Headlines/slogans [Mood]

All which help to design a full website.

One thing to note is that the left column of webstiles largely defines mood, while the right deals with the techinical stuff.

## Signing off

I now use webstiles in every project of mine — and I strongly believe you should too. Try it once, download the template.
